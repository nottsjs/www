Modern websites using JavaScript to render page content (such as React, Angular, Vue etc) are now so common that it's rare to find a website without at least some sort of JavaScript modifying the DOM. This can lead to unexpected results in searches, with little or no support for your website's rendering code.

Search engines such as Google have very specific support for rending your website during a crawl. Edd will run through how Googlebot works, how JavaScript websites can improve their rankings, and present some examples.
