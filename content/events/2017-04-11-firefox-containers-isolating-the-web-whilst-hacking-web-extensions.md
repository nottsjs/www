Presenting Jonathan Kingston with his talk and workshop: "_Firefox Containers,
isolating the web whilst hacking web extensions_".

**Bring your laptops with a copy of [Firefox
Nightly](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/nightly/all/) installed as we
will hack away at building your own extensions using bleeding edge features.**

Firefox Containers tabs are an experimental platform feature for tab management
and isolating browsing to solve security and privacy issues.

With the recent launch of [containers to
test](https://testpilot.firefox.com/experiments/containers) pilot, I'm going to
walk through how they are built.  Web Extensions are the new cross browser way
of adding features to the browser built entirely from JavaScript and other web
technologies.  New web extension features were added to Firefox for building our
containers experiment that you can use today.

I will cover the basics of building extensions so we can have half the evening
on hacking and making extensions.
