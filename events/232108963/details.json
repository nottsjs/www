Now that the Web Audio API is well-supported, some really interesting stuff is being done with it, and this talk will show you how it's an ideal way to make charts and plots more accessible.</p> <p><br/><a href=\"https://github.com/nottsjs/speakers/issues/20\"> Server-Side Rendering of React on Java 8 Nashorn with Spring Boot</a><br/><i>by <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/ruthmills\">ruth-connect</a></i></p> <p>How do you use the Nashorn JS engine on Java 8 to perform server-side rendering React on Spring Boot? Come along to find out!</p> <p><br/>This talk will cover the Nashorn JS engine, including the ability to execute JS code on the server-side from within a Java application (and even have the JS code call Java code); how to integrate the Nashorn JS engine within the view layer of a Spring web application; and how to use Nashorn to render the initial state of a React application on the server.</p> <p><b>After</b></p> <p>Afterwards we'll head around the corner to <a href=\"http://www.castlerockbrewery.co.uk/pubs/keans-head/\">Keans Head</a> for more JavaScript socialising.</p> <p><b>Contact</b></p> <p>Ask questions or to talk to our friendly community at:</p> <p><a href=\"https://gitter.im/nottsjs/discuss\"><a href=\"https://gitter.im/nottsjs/discuss\" class=\"linkified\">https://gitter.im/nottsjs/discuss</a></a></p> <p><br/>Find us on twitter:</p> <p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/nottsjs\">@nottsjs</a></p> ",
